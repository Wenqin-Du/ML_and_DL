# Deep Neural Networks Project: Compressive Algorithm 

# SGDcomp 
SGDcomp is an optimizer that can learn a small sub-network during training, if one starts from an overparameterized dense network.


# SAMcomp 
Follow the same idea, apply the compressive algorithm to Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer. Algorithm performence becomes even better.
