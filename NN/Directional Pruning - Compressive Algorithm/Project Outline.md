# Deep Neural Networks Project: Compressive Algorithm 

## SGDcomp and SAMcomp 
SGDcomp is an optimizer that can learn a small sub-network during training, if one starts from an overparameterized dense network. Follow the same idea, apply the compressive algorithm to Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer. Algorithm performence becomes even better.
